# Levy (2008) notes

American English speakers assimilate Parisian French vowels in a carrier phrase and carrier word. Familiarity and consonantal context vary.

## Method

### Participants

- 39 participants born and raised in the US with varying levels of experience:
    - NoExp (naive)
    - ModExp (formal training)
    - HiExp (years of formal training + immersion experience)

### Stimuli

- Three adult female native speakers of Parisian French
- Two carrier phrase consonantal contexts:
    - Labial: "neuf /rabVp/ à des amis."
    - Alveolar: "neuf /radVt/ à des amis."
- Seven vowels, three times per speaker:
    - /y, œ, i, u, ε, o, a/

#### Acoustic properties

- [y] F1, F2 much closer to American English /i/ than /u/
    - *Relevant to model's classification?*
- [u] and [o] fronted (higher F2) in alveolar context
- [y] F1, F2 halfway between American English /i/ and /u/ in alveolar context

### Procedure

- Keyword, task, stimulus familiarization procedures precede experimental trials
    - Keyword familiarization: Read thirteen American English keywords (/hVd/) heed, hid, hayed, head, had, hod, hawed, hud, hoed, hood, who’d, hued, and herd
    - Task familiarization: Listen to phrases "five /ɡəCVCə/ this time" in either /bVp/ or /dVt/ context with vowels /i/, /ɪ/, /e/, /ɛ/, /æ/, /ɑ/, /ɔ/, /ʌ/, /o/, /ʊ/, /u/, /ʲu/, and /ɜ˞/ and then select American English keyword with most similar vowel, then rate 1-9 from foreign-sounding to nativelike
    - Stimulus familiarization: Listen to French stimuli; either all bilabial followed by all alveolar, or vice-versa
- Experimental trials: All three tokens of each of the seven vowels from each of the three speakers, twice; randomized within each of the two blocks. Latin square for order of speakers within each context. Total eighteen judgements per vowel per context
    - Listen to French phrase once, pay attention to second vowel in nonsense word, ignore other aspects of phrases
    - Select the American English keyword (out of the thirteen) with the most similar vowel to the target vowel
        - /ʲu/ was included due to previous evidence for spontaneous adaption of french /y/ as [ʲu]
            - Studies that don't include this find assimilation primarily to back vowels
    - Listen again, and rate from 1-9

## Results

- Language experience effects for some comparisons on all vowels except /i/ and /u/ (assimilated as /i/ and /u/ respectively)
    - More consistent responses in HiExp than in other groups
- Context effects for /a, y, o, œ/, not for /i, ɛ, u/
    - More consistent responses in bilabial than alveolar context
- Some vowels were assimilated less consistently than others (e.g. /i/ > /y/ > /œ/)
- Front round vowels were overwhelmingly assimilated to back vowels (including /ʲu/)
- By vowel:
    - /i/ overwhelmingly assimilated as /i/
    - /ɛ/ conditioned by experience, not context
        - largely assimilated as /ɛ/, moreso in MidExp and HiExp
        - occasionally assimilated as /æ/ by NoExp only, and occasionally assimilated as /e/ by all
    - /a/ conditioned by experience and context
        - mostly /æ/ followed by /ɑ/ in alveolar, reversed for bilabial context, not conditioned by experience
        - assimilated as /ɛ/ by ModExp > NoExp > HiExp, apparently not conditioned by context (table suggests only in alveolar)
    - /o/ conditioned by experience, context, and their interaction
        - more often /u/ than /o/ by NoExp, reversed in MidExp and HiExp
        - MidExp occasionally /u/, more often than HiExp which was overwhelmingly /o/
        - NoExp assimilated as /u/ more often in bilabial than alveolar context
        - No context effect in MidExp or HiExp
    - /u/ somewhat conditioned by experience and context
        - overwhelmingly /u/, occasionally /ʲu/
        - no pairwise comparisons significant, but overall effect significant
        - table doesn't suggest any overall meaningful pattern
        - table shows occasionally /o/ by HiExp in bilabial context
    - /y/ conditioned by experience and context
        - largely /ʲu/ for both, more in bilabial context
        - occasionally /u/, more often in alveolar context especially for less experienced groups
        - ModExp assimilates to /ʲu/ in a bilabial context more often than NoExp, HiExp
        - no experience effect in alveolar context
        - assimilations to /i/ were largely driven by one person in NoExp, who responded /i/ every time in the bilabial context and never in the alveolar context
        - still very rarely assimilated to /i/ by NoExp and ModExp
        - more consistent in HiExp than in ModExp or NoExp, not conditioned by context
    - /œ/ conditioned by experience and context
        - more categories than /y/ overall
        - generally pretty weird
        - mostly /ʊ/
        - sometimes /u/, decreases heavily with experience, less often in bilabial context
        - occasionally /o/, decreases with experience in bilabial context, ModExp > NoExp > HiExp in alveolar context, less often in bilabial context
        - sometimes /ɜ˞/ in HiExp only
        - much more consistent in HiExp than in NoExp or ModExp
