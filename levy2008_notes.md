# Levy (2008) notes

American English speakers assimilate Parisian French vowels in a carrier phrase and carrier word. Familiarity and consonantal context vary.

## Method

### Participants

- 39 participants born and raised in the US with varying levels of experience:
    - NoExp (naive)
    - ModExp (formal training)
    - HiExp (years of formal training + immersion experience)

### Stimuli

- Three adult female native speakers of Parisian French
- Two carrier phrase consonantal contexts:
    - Labial: "neuf /rabVp/ à des amis."
    - Alveolar: "neuf /radVt/ à des amis."
- Nine vowels, three times per speaker:
    - /y, œ, i, u, ε, o, a/
    - **The first and second formants of [y] overlapped with [i], and was much further from [u], especially in the bilabial context** — *Relevant to model's classification?*
